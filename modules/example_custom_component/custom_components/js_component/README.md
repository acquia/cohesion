# Javascript component

This custom component demonstrates how a developer can create a custom component using javascript only.

All form values are stored in an object on a div's data attribute `data-ssa-custom-component`. This div will have a class
with the custom component ID (the file name of the yml file). See `js_component.custom_component.yml` for code details

This example also demonstrates that you can get field data and apply to CSS or you can attach your own CSS file
to the custom component. See `js_component.custom_component.yml` for how to add your CSS/JS file to a custom component
