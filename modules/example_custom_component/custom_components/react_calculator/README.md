# ReactJS custom component

This example demonstrates how to create a custom component for a ReactJS app.

The html template needs to be declared in the `.yml` file (see `react.custom_component.yml`).

This example also demonstrates that you can get field data and apply toCSS
or you can attach your own CSS file
to the custom component. See `react.custom_component.yml` for how to add your CSS/JS file to a customcomponent.
