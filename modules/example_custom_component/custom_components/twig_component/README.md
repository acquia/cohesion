# Twig custom component

This example demonstrates how to create a custom component rendering inside a twig template. 

The `field` variable contains all field data, so that it can be rendered using the machine name of the field.
The `dropzones` variable contains all dropzones and are pre-rendered.

Twig functions are provided to render special field like entity reference, wysiwyg, entity browser.

This also demonstrates how to get a field to drive inline CSS and render that CSS in the head.
